- Accept multiple pattern strings
- Fix edge cases:
  - A major minor version `0.3` will be zero'd out to `0.3.0`
  - This is fine, except with the pessimistic operator
- Don't assume spaces are provided. Accept `>4.5.6` as a pattern
- Add command line interface
- Auto sort any arrays of results?
- Can I auto expand tilde on the command line: `versions ~/somedir` ?
- Searching by name is a bit too loose. If I search 'foo' it matches 'foobar'
- Support no names, just raw version strings '0.0.45'
- When searching by name I return the newest result. Add a "*" pattern to return all matching filepaths for that name
